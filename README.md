Application:  The Riddler

Author:  Jeanette Fairless

Description:  The Riddler is intended to be  a site where a riddle can be
posted and users can submit possible answers.

Set-up:
1.  Run python -m SimpleHTTPServer and find the application at localhost:8000

Known Issues:
This app does not work:
1.  I first used the libs from my original dracula-blogger. The app came up
with no errors, but nothing would display. I went through everything on the
console and the inspector, but there were no errors and no clue that anything
was wrong.  I googled the problem but all I could find was solutions from 2013
and later, which was a lot of versions ago.  The code didn't even resemble
mine.

2.  So, I tried using the libs from Kelly's github.  I had several errors that
I couldn't resolve.  

3.  I moved my original libs from my dracula-blogger back into the app, and
I also had 404 errors (which I didn't have in my first version).  The only one
I could resolve was the bootstrap 404.

Conclusion:  It's almost 4pm and I've been fighting this all day.  I give up.  I
hate ember!  I hope I never have to use it.  This has been the worst day I've
ever spent at Epicodus and the worst job I've ever done on a code review.

I'm looking forward to moving on to ember cli and rails!  I'm sure that will be
much better :)
